# angular-dynamic-controllers

This is a demo made for angular dynamic controllers.

Rather than writing static controllers, I have dynamically created controllers on the fly whenever needed.

To run this project, make sure node.js is installed on your pc.

Download source code.

Goto source containing folder using node command line.

type in, node server.js // (windows user)

target localhost:8081 in browser.
